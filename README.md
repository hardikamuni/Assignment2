 The second file what we have is the R code in the name of HardikaAssignment2.Rnw. You need to upload this file and the excel file in the R studio in your directory 
 and then press the compile pdf button on the upper side to run the code. This will give you a PDF file which will be the same 
 as the third file in the repository which is named as HardikaAssignment2.pdf
